## Purpose
DonDS is created for fun and community-driven memes in the crypto world. It is not a financial product and should not be treated as one.

## Token Security & Transparency
To demonstrate full transparency and commitment to community trust, **33.57% of the total DonDS token supply (141 billion tokens)** has been **permanently locked** using the **UNCX Network liquidity locker**.

These tokens have been locked **for security reasons**, ensuring:
- No rug pull is possible
- A transparent and fair launch
- Long-term trust in the project

Inspired by the transparency of meme coins like **$PEPE**, DonDS follows a similar philosophy:  
**No promises, no central control — just pure, decentralized fun.**

## Community
DonDS encourages participation, memes, and self-expression. Everyone is free to build and contribute.

## Disclaimer
DonDS is for entertainment only. It has no intrinsic value or expectation of financial return. Always DYOR (Do Your Own Research).
